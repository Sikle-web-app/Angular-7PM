Step 1.
    create the AWS Account

    https://aws.amazon.com/   (credit card / debit card information)


Step 2.
    create S3 Bucket in AWS

    S3 bucket is nothing but repository


Step 3.
    deploy images to S3 Bucket

    => https://ng7pm.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/p1.jpg

    => https://ng7pm.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/p2.jpg

    => https://ng7pm.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/p3.jpg

    => https://ng7pm.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/p4.jpg

    => https://ng7pm.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/p5.jpg

    => https://ng7pm.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/p6.jpg


Step 4.
    create the database in mongodb

    URL : https://account.mongodb.com/account/login

    database name  : ng7pm

    collection name : products

    user name : admin

    password : admin

    connection URL : mongodb+srv://admin:admin@miniprojectdb.nzphu.mongodb.net/ng7pm?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Step 5.
    create the node server

    => nodejs used to develop the servers

            Http Server

            TCP Server

    => we will develop node server by using JavaScript.

    => node supports the modules

        1) express

            - express used to develop the rest services.

            Ex.
                    GET
                    POST
                    PUT
                    DELETE
        2) cors

            - cors library used to enable the ports communication.

        3) mongodb

            - mongodb used to connect to mongodb database.
        
        4) body-parser

            - body-parser module used to read the data from client application

    a) create the directory (folder)

        Ex.
                backend

    b) switch to backend directory

        > cd backend

    c) download the libraries

            => express

            => cors

            => mongodb

            => body-parser

        > yarn add express cors mongodb body-parser --save

        all the libraries downloads to "node_modules" folder in current path.

    d) implement the node server

        Ex.
            server.js

    e) start the server

        > node server

    f) test the rest api by using "Postman"

        > http://localhost:8080/api/products

    => Services  (RxJS)

    => CSS3 & HTML5     (Responsive Web Design)

    => Font Awasome   (Rating)

    => communication Between Components

    => Single Page Applications  (Routing)

    => State Management (NgRx)


step 1.
    create the angular application

    > ng new frontend


step 2.
    create the service to consume following rest api call

    => http://localhost:8080/api/products

    **********************************************
    frontend
           src
             app
               modal
                product.ts
               services
                 products.service.ts
    ***********************************************

    finally "Product" modal is ready

    finally "ProductsService" is ready with "getProducts()" function.
