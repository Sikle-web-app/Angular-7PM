==========
1) Installation of Angular11

2) create the Angular11 Project

3) Directory Structure of Angular11 Project


Installation of Angular11
=========================
1) download and install NodeJS

    - npm is the tool, helps to install the Angular11.

    - npm stands for node packaging manager.

    - npm is the tool, present in NodeJS.


website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v14.16.0-x64.msi


2) install yarn tool

    yarn is the tool, provided by facebook.

    yarn tool, used to download the 3rd party libraries.

    we will install yarn tool, by using following command.

    > npm install -g yarn

    - "-g" stands for global Installation.

    current version of yarn tool is  yarn@1.22.10


3) install Angular11

    - we will install Angular11 by using following command.

    > npm install -g @angular/cli

    cli stands for command line interface

    cli is the tool, provided by "google"

    cli helps to create and execute the angular projects


4) link the yarn tool to cli tool

    > ng set --global packageManager=yarn


5) install VisualStudioCode

    - VisualStudioCode is the IDE

    - VSCode Provided by Microsoft.

    - VSCode IDE recomended to develop UI Applications

    Ex.
            angular
            react
            vuejs


website : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

file    :  VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.53.2.exe



create the first angular Application
====================================
step 1.

    create the directory   (folder)

    Ex.
            Angular11@7   (open with VSCode)

step 2.
    create the angular project

    > ng new firstApp

    where "firstApp" is the name of the project

step 3.
    switch to angular application

    > cd firstApp

step 4.
    execute the angular application

    > ng s -o

    "s" stands for serve

    "-o" stands for open the default browser

    the default port number of angular application is 4200

Directory Structure of Angular Application
==========================================

e2e
===
    e2e stands for end to end.

    e2e directory used to write the end to end test cases

node_modules
============
    it containes libraries.

    these libraries helps to execute the angular applications.


src/app
=======
    it is used to deploy the angular applications

    Ex.
        single page applications

        services

        components

        pipes

        directives

        ----
        ----
        ----

src / app / app.module.ts
=========================

- above file we can call registration file.

- above file we can call default module file.

- as a angular developer, we must register our applications

Ex.
    components
    services
    ---
    ---
    ---

src / app / app.component.ts

            app.component.html

            app.component.css

            app.component.spec.ts

=======================================

    - when ever we create angular project, automatically "AppComponent" is the default component.

    - all unit test cases files should have ".spec.ts" extension


src/assets
==========
    - it is used to deploy the static resources.

    Ex.

        images

        logos

        xml files

        json files

        fonts

src/environments
================

    - in general, we have following environments.

    1) development environment

    2) production environment

    3) testing environment

    - we can configure required environment here.

src / favicon.ico
=================

    - this logo representing default logo of angular

src / index.html
================

    - angular starts the extension from "index.html" file.

    - "index.html" file is the main template.

src / main.ts
=============

    - main.ts file acting as interface between index.html to app.module.ts file.

    - angular starts the execution from index.html file

    - index.html file immidiately invokes the "main.ts" file.

    - main.ts file immidiately executes the app.module.ts file.

    - app.module.ts file containes our applications registrations.

    - based on our applications registrations, angular framework will execute the applications.

src / polyfills.ts
==================

    - in general, we will prepare angular applications by using TypeScript.

    - as a angular developer, we must convert TypeScript to Equalent JavaScript.

    - polyfills acting as library, used to convert the TypeScript to Equalent JavaScript.

src / styles.css
================

    - here, we can configure global styles.

    - these styles applicable to entire angular application.

src / test.ts
=============

    - this is the sample testing file.

.browserslistrc
===============

    - it containes supporting browsers of Angular11

angular.json
============

    - it describes angular application directory structure.

karma.conf.js
=============

    - in general, we will write unit test cases by using karma tool.

    - this file representing, configuration file of karma tool.

package.json
=============

    - it is used to download the 3rd party libraries.


tsconfig.app.json
=================

    - it is used to configure the application devel configurations


tsconfig.json
=============

    - this file representing TypeScript configurations

tsconfig.spec.json
==================

    - this file acting as controlling file for all test cases

tslint.json
===========

    - this file acting as validator file for TypeScript.

=======================================================================
1) Components                                   OOPS

2) Services                                     Modules

3) Single Page Applications                     packages

4) RxJS  (Rest API Calls)                           Workshop : debouncing & Throttling

5) NgRx (State Management)
========================================================================================

ECommerce Application    (40 days)

npx gitignore node
==================
    - used to avoid the movement of libraries to GitHub Repository.
